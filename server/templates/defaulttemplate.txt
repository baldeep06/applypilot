Dear [Hiring manager name OR "Hiring Manager"],

I am writing to express my interest in the [simplified role title - make it logical and concise] position at [company name]. As a [field of study] student at [university], I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and gain valuable experience in the field.

[PARAGRAPH 2 - EXACTLY 90-105 WORDS - COUNT YOUR WORDS]
FOCUS: Deep dive on 2-3 key overlapping technologies

Instructions:
- Identify the 2-3 MOST important technologies that appear in BOTH the job posting AND resume
- For each technology, explain your experience naturally (rephrase, don't copy resume)
- Go deeper on fewer technologies rather than listing many
- Connect this experience to what the role needs
- Sound like a real person explaining their background, not listing credentials
- Keep under 105 words

Example: "I noticed the role involves working with React and Python, which I've used extensively in my previous work. At [Company], I built several web applications with React, focusing on creating responsive user interfaces. I also spent time working with Python for backend services and data processing. This combination seems like a great match for the full-stack work you're looking for, and I'm excited about the chance to bring that experience to [Company's specific project/product]."

[PARAGRAPH 3 - EXACTLY 90-105 WORDS - COUNT YOUR WORDS]
FOCUS: What the COMPANY is doing (60-70% about company, 30-40% about you)

Instructions:
- Start by talking about what the company is doing (mission, products, recent news, initiatives)
- Show you've researched them and understand their work
- Then naturally connect to relevant soft skills you have
- Keep the focus on THEM and what they're building, not just listing your qualities
- Sound genuinely interested, not formulaic
- Keep under 105 words

Example: "I've been following [Company]'s work on [specific product/initiative], and I'm really impressed by how you're approaching [specific challenge/opportunity]. The recent [news/development] caught my attention because it shows your commitment to [value/mission]. I'm drawn to this kind of collaborative, mission-driven environment. In my past roles, I've found that I do my best work when I'm part of a team tackling meaningful problems, and that seems to be exactly what this role offers."

I am confident that my [2-3 general skills that match job] and strong work ethic would make me a valuable asset to [company - use shortened name if appropriate]. I am eager to contribute my skills and learn from the talented professionals at your company. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Full name]
