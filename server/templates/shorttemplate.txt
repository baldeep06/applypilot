SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: You are generating a cover letter. STRICT COMPLIANCE with all rules below is MANDATORY.

===== ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION WILL RESULT IN REJECTION =====

RULE 1: TOTAL LENGTH = 150-200 WORDS MAXIMUM (½ page)
RULE 2: FIRST PARAGRAPH = 60-75 WORDS MAXIMUM
RULE 3: SECOND PARAGRAPH = 60-75 WORDS MAXIMUM
RULE 4: Use simple, concise language - sound HUMAN, not like AI listing things
RULE 5: NEVER use em dashes (—) anywhere in the letter
RULE 6: Simplify role names to their logical form (e.g., "Summer Technology/Developer" becomes "Summer Developer")
RULE 7: Write naturally and conversationally - avoid formulaic or robotic phrasing
RULE 8: Get straight to the point - no fluff, be direct and brief

===== FORBIDDEN ACTIONS =====
❌ NEVER sound like you're listing qualifications robotically
❌ NEVER use overly complex or verbose language
❌ NEVER add extra blank lines - use ONLY single line breaks between sections
❌ NEVER use em dashes (—) - use commas or periods instead
❌ NEVER copy exact sentences from the resume word-for-word
❌ NEVER list many technologies - focus on 1-2 most relevant ones
❌ NEVER add unnecessary filler words or phrases
❌ NEVER start consecutive sentences with the same structure or word
❌ NEVER use phrases like "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover," "In addition,"
❌ NEVER write sentences that feel disconnected - each should flow into the next
❌ NEVER use transition words that sound academic or formal

===== REQUIRED APPROACH =====
✅ Write like a real person having a conversation
✅ Use the full role title once, then shorten it naturally (e.g., "Summer Developer" → "developer")
✅ In paragraph 1: Focus on 1-2 key overlapping technologies, rephrase resume experiences briefly
✅ In paragraph 2: Express interest in the company directly (more casual/direct tone)
✅ Keep sentences short and direct
✅ Be conversational, not formal or stiff
✅ Be brief - every word counts

===== FLOW AND TRANSITIONS =====
✅ Vary sentence structure - mix short and longer sentences naturally
✅ Use conversational connectors: "and," "so," "which," "while," "since"
✅ Let ideas flow into each other - second sentence should build on first
✅ Think: "How would I explain this to a friend?" not "How do I list my qualifications?"
✅ Read it aloud - if it sounds stilted or robotic, rewrite it
✅ Keep it tight - in this short format, every transition word must earn its place

{{JOB_TEXT}}

Resume (FOR REFERENCE ONLY - USE FOR INSPIRATION):

===== EXACT OUTPUT FORMAT =====

Dear [Hiring manager name OR "Hiring Manager"],

I am writing to express my interest in the [simplified role title - make it logical and concise] position at [company name]. As a [field of study] student at [university], I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

[PARAGRAPH 1 - EXACTLY 60-75 WORDS - COUNT YOUR WORDS]
FOCUS: Briefly mention 1-2 key technical skills that overlap with job - with natural flow

Instructions:
- Identify the 1-2 MOST important technologies that appear in BOTH the job posting AND resume
- Tell a brief story about your experience - don't just state facts
- Let each sentence flow naturally into the next - avoid choppy statements
- Use "and," "while," "which" to connect ideas smoothly (but be economical)
- Connect this experience to what the role needs without saying "This aligns with..." or "This matches..."
- Keep under 75 words
- Be direct and concise - no filler

Better Example: "I noticed the role involves React and Python, which I've been working with at [Company]. I built web applications where I used React for the frontend while handling backend services with Python. This full-stack experience seems like it'd translate well to what you're building, especially with [specific project if known]."

Avoid: "I have experience with React. I also worked with Python. Additionally, I developed applications. This aligns with your requirements."

[PARAGRAPH 2 - EXACTLY 60-75 WORDS - COUNT YOUR WORDS]
FOCUS: Express interest in company (casual/direct tone) - with natural flow

Instructions:
- Start with what drew you to the company - specific product, mission, or development
- Show genuine interest with a casual, direct tone - not generic praise
- Let your enthusiasm come through naturally
- Connect their work to why you're interested without explicitly saying "I value..." or "This aligns..."
- Use natural connectors to tie sentences together
- Avoid formal transition words
- Keep under 75 words
- Be direct and brief - no fluff

Better Example: "I've been following [Company]'s work on [specific product/initiative], and the way you're approaching [challenge] really stands out. I've always done my best work on teams solving meaningful problems collaboratively, which seems to be exactly what you've built here."

Avoid: "I am impressed by [Company]. Additionally, I value collaboration. Furthermore, I align with your mission."

I am confident that my [2 general skills that match job] would make me a valuable asset to [company - use shortened name if appropriate]. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
[Full name]
