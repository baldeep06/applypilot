- Does NOT copy exact phrases from job description
- Does NOT use placeholders like "[Programming Language]"
- References general technical capabilities (e.g., "full-stack development experience")
- Keeps it under 30 words

Example: "I am eager to leverage my experience with React, Python, and cloud infrastructure to contribute to your team's mission of building scalable web applications."

===== BULLET_POINTS INSTRUCTIONS =====
Extract THREE relevant experiences/projects from the resume that align with the job description.

Format EXACTLY like this:
·        **[Company/Project Name] ([Role/Description]):** [2-3 sentences describing relevant work, technologies used, and impact. Focus on technical skills and achievements that match the job requirements.]

Requirements:
- Use the bullet character: ·
- Bold the text before the colon using **text**
- Each bullet should be 2-3 sentences (40-60 words each)
- Focus on experiences that match job requirements
- Include specific technologies mentioned in both resume AND job description
- Last bullet should typically be "Technical Projects" if available
- NO generic placeholders - use actual project/company names from resume
- Prioritize recent and relevant experiences

Example format:
·        **Ontario Power Generation (Software Engineer Intern):** I worked on enterprise web applications using C# and .NET, redesigned legacy systems for modern web deployment, and integrated identity and access control features. I also scripted automation tasks and optimized SQL queries.

·        **Headstarter AI (Software Engineer Fellow):** I gained hands-on experience building AI-driven apps and APIs leveraging OpenAI, ReactJS, Pinecone, and LangChain. I was responsible for full-cycle development within a collaborative team, applying Agile practices.

·        **Technical Projects:** I've designed and implemented end-to-end systems such as an AI-powered resume IDE, a document-querying RAG pipeline, and a robo-advising algorithm. These projects showcase my ability to work across the stack and blend creativity with technical expertise.
